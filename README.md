#### About me

As a developer, I feel rewarded whenever I see the web services we developed helping users. By developing applications, we have done the necessary tasks so that users can solve their problems with the service we have made

To develop more user-friendly frontends, I always continue to communicate with our team members and improve our projects.

I have experience optimizing network requests on web pages and optimizing search engines through server-side rendering.
